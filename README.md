# zdraw
Simple drawing program written in Zig

This was born out of an interest to re-write [my entry](https://github.com/taylorplewe/flopathon-2025/tree/sdl) into a work competition from C to Zig.

Requires SDL & `zig`.

### Build instructions
Make sure to edit `build.zig` to contain the paths to your SDL directories.
```sh
zig build
```
